####Minerva is a natural language chatbot whose path may go in a few places:
- help people learn English by telling them all about the sentences they write and providing lots of interesting things to learn in English
- provide factual conversation for people to learn from
- give interesting and slightly randomized conversation from current events

###Running Minerva:
`./chatboy.py`
Then follow the instructions in the terminal.

###Current functionality:
Minerva currently accepts text input and analyzes the sentence for nouns and then spits back the definition as well as a random example of the first noun that is used in the string... a long way to go to sentience...

###Dependencies (you can install all these wit pip:
- python3
- wordnik-py3
- nltk
- beautifulsoup4

###To Do List:
- build scraper to search wikipedia for interesting facts
- decide on intro, how should it start? the same every time or slightly random
